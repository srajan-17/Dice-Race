# Project: Dice Race iOS App

# This project is an iOS app that features a dice race. After each press of the roll/restart button, each pair of dice is rolled and the sum of the numbers on the dice is added to each player's (Player and Computer) total sum. The first player to have a sum of 150 or higher after a roll of the dice wins. If both players cross the sum of 150 after a roll of the dice, the player with the higher sum wins. If both players have the same sum after reaching 150 or higher, the race is a tie. The project can be opened and tested using Xcode on a Mac.

# This project was written using Swift.
